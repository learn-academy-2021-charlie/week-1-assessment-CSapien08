# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a chunk of reusable code that perfoms some logic to solve a either a reoccuring problem or a simplfy a task. You would use a function to perform a task that you want your code to complete or do.

  Researched answer: From *'MDN Web Docs,'* webiste a functions is similiar to percedure with a set of statements that performs a taske or calculates a value. However, in order for it to quaily as a function it should take some input and return an output.
  
2. In regards to functions, what is the difference between an argument and a parameter?

  Your answer: A parameter is a placeholder for the value within the functions definition, while the argument is the actual value being passed in to the function.

  Researched answer: From *'MDN Web Docs,'* A parameter is the name listed in the function's definition and the arguements are the real values that are passed to the function. It then describes the actions between the two associations, so when a parameter is initialized, it is initialized to the vales of the arguements that are supplied. 



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: The index is used to describe the location of a associated value within the array. The difference between index and value is that the index is used to get the user the value stored at the location of the index.

  Researched answer: From *'National institue of Standards and Techonoloy,'* an index is the location of an item in an array. Not sure how else to word it that answer is defines it preciesly.



4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: A built-in method is a method provided by javascript that uses a reserved keywork to perform a common task. One example of this is toUpperCase(). 

  Researched answer: It was hard to pin point a good definition from my google research. However, I think the Learn Academy describes it best when they say it is a piece of fucntionality that Javascript added to accomplish a common task. While not all built-in methods have mutators and accessors I did like how they described the built-in methods for arrays being either a mutator or a an accessor.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Driver and Navigator. The Driver is the person who is taking action, meaning they have their hands on the keyboard typing and following instructions from the Navigator. The Navigator is providing the information to the driver as well as checking to make the sure driver is following syntax and entering the correct information. 

  Researched answer: From Learn Academy, the driver is the one with their hands on the keyboard whom is entering information and following the instructions from the navigator using constant communication. It also notes that it is important for the team to switch every 10-20 minutes. 



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: I found that pair programming was the most helpful. I have taken course where the instructor gives you ton of information and then says go figure it out, which isn't necessarily a wrong thing, but when we take some time to figure it out as a team, it definetly helped me understand the topics a little better before going on reseaching them myself.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Iteration: Iteration means to repeat a process x amount of times. In terms of javascript iteration is used with loops to iterate over an array or perform a task x amount of times.

2. Higher Order Functions: A higher order function is a funtion that takes one or more functions as an agruement and returns a function.

3. Jest: Jest is a JavaScript testing framework that provides code coverage and mocking to help test the code base. 

4. Classes: Classes are "special funtions" they enscapsulate data with code to wok on that data.

5. React: React is a JavaScript library used to help create user interfaces easily.
